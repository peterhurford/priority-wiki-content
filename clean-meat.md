# Clean Meat
* ["**Cellular agriculture: An extension of common production methods for food**"](http://www.gfi.org/images/uploads/2018/03/Cellular-Agriculture-for-Animal-Protein.pdf) - This publication, co-written by the Senior Scientist of the Good Food Institute, gives a great overview of the science of cellular agriculture. http://www.gfi.org/images/uploads/2018/03/Cellular-Agriculture-for-Animal-Protein.pdf

"What should we call meat grown outside of an animal? “Meat” is clearly important, because it is meat all the way down to to the cellular level – animal muscle, fat, and connective tissue cells. 
"Lab-grown" is just wrong. At scale, clean meat will be produced in a clean facility similar to a brewery. New types of beer are developed in test labs, but beer isn’t “lab-brewed.” All processed food begins in a food lab, but we don’t call Cheerios "lab-created Cheerios."
...At GFI, we did not start out wanting to use “clean” over “cultured.” Instead, we were convinced by a combination of these two factors: 1. Our experience at the IFT [Institute of Food Technologists] conference and other similar situations where people were confused by “cultured,” and 2. The consumer research. 
We know that for various reasons, some people may continue saying “lab-grown” or “cultured.” That’s fine, of course. We just want everyone to understand why we prefer and advocate a shift to talking about "clean meat.""
