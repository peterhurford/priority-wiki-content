<!-- TITLE: Developed World Health Policy -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Developed World Health -->

* **Summary of the problem:** Policy for improving health could be a high-leverage way to improve a wide variety of health outcomes.
* **Summary of solutions:** Advocacy for better health policies.
* **General sense:** Federal governments already devote a lot of resources to this. It is unclear but unlikely that there are opportunities to improve developed world health that are cost-competitive with improving developing world health.
