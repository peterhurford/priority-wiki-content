# Fundraising for effective charities
> Individual donors, governments and firms demonstrate substantial generosity (e.g., UK charity represents 0.5-1% of GDP). However, most donations go towards charities that are worthwhile but improve human well-being far less per-$ than basic medical interventions in poor countries, such as antimalarial bednets (see Givewell.org). 

> Social science, biology and philosophy present a range of potential theoretical explanations of how values, preferences, and biases drive this ‘inefficient altruism’. However, evidence (e.g., for "availability bias", or "scope insensitivity") comes largely from small-scale experiments in domains outside of charitable-giving. It is difficult to distinguish robust, credible findings from one-off results that are vulnerable to hype, p-hacking and publication bias (echoing the "replication crisis" in experimental social science). Given the limited, scattered findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors substantially impact "effective giving and support for policies that reduce extreme poverty."

> The EA movement is highly-motivated, growing, and gaining funding. However, it represents a niche audience: the "hyper-analytic but morally-scrupulous". EA organisations have focused on identifying effective causes and career paths, but have pursued limited  outreach or market research on a larger audience (see Charity Science, Gates Foundation/Ideas42).

## Innovationsinfundraising.org

> Innovations in Fundraising (IiF) aims to foster, synthesise, and disseminate evidence that will inform practical methods of boosting EG/support. This project will involve a high level of collaboration and cooperation, enabled by the intrinsic motivation of researchers in this area. We will pursue rigorous, replicated evidence and meta-analysis, open science and methodological integrity, incorporating tools and standards of the 'credibility revolution in social science'.

The [IiF wiki]((https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php) collects and presents evidence on the most successful approaches to motivating effective and impactful charitable giving, and promotes innovative research and its application. The wiki is a continuous work in progress and a living resource. We consider recent and replicated academic work, a clear explanation of relevant theories and definitions, description of real-world experiences in innovative fundraising. We are also organizing data and statistics from empirical research that can be interactively explored and used as a base for meta-analyses and future work. This is aimed both as a knowledge base for academic researchers and a collection of tools for practitioners and advocates. This is a collaborative effort: all are encouraged to comment and contribute!
