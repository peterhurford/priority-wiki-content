<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Developed World Education -->

* **Summary of the problem:** Student outcomes in the developed world are still lower and far more inequal than they could be. Improving the quality and distribution of education outcomes could improve society.
* **Summary of solutions:** The overall scope of interventions is not currently clear.
* **General sense:** There is a tremendous amount of philanthropic and government investment in improving education, but not much is known about how to make this investment more effective or the overall cost-effectiveness of this space.
