# Summary
Using the right metrics is important to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. The most commonly used measure for the cost-effectiveness of near-term human welfare is the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). 

**Criticism**
However, the use of QALYs has recently been criticised (source) because it relies on a methodology that systematically overestimates the impact of certain disabilities (e.g. loss of mobility). As a consequence, disabilities that score high on multiple measures (e.g. extreme pain, mental disabilities) might be underprioritized.

**Criteria for selecting a measure**
In selecting the right measure, at least the following criteria are important:
* *Validity*: does it measure what we want it to measure?
* *Availability*: is there enough data available to compare the impact of different interventions?
* ..

**Types of measures**
* Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALY's) & Disability-Adjusted LIfe-Years (DALY's)
* Subjective Wellbeing (SWB) measures
* Life Satisfaction measures.
