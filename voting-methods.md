# Definition
A **Voting Method** is a system by which a group votes on a decision. It consists of (a) how options are listed on a ballot (b) 

# Potential Impact and Tractability
Every single policy decision in democratic countries ultimately depends on elections. As such, improving voting methods has the potential to positively impact nearly all other policies set by democratic country governments. 

All democracies use poorly designed voting methods--particularly "plurality voting"--in which voters get to select only a single candidate and the candidate with the most votes (but, not necessarily a majority) wins.  One of the worst problems of this system is that it decisively limits the the number of candidates that can viably run, thus limiting political competition for populations to select the best leaders. See "further reading" for some of the game theory involved. Unfortunately, no voting method is "perfect." Every voting method has some drawbacks. But, research suggests that approval voting for single-winner elections (e.g. president) and proportional-representation for multi-winner elections (e.g. congress) would create the smallest gaps between what the population wants and what it gets.

Voting method reform is likely less tractable and higher impact than public health causes, while it is likely more tractable and lower impact than existential risk causes. In the U.S., the state of Maine and several well-known cities (Minneapolis, Santa Fe) passed reform of voting methods in the last few years.
