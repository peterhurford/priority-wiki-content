<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Voting Methods -->

# Definition
A **Voting Method** is a system by which a group votes on a decision. It consists of (a) which options can appear on the ballet (b) what type of information voters can put on their ballot (c) how votes are tallied to make a decision.

# Potential Impact and Tractability
Every single policy decision in democratic countries ultimately depends on elections. As such, improving voting methods has the potential to positively impact nearly all other policies set by democratic country governments. 

All democracies use poorly designed voting methods. Most use "plurality voting," in which voters get to select only a single candidate and the candidate with the most votes (but, not necessarily a majority) wins.  While plurality voting may seem common-sense ... it actually has some very unfortunate properties for the population and creates a large gap between the decisions an electorate prefers and the decisions that get made. Two particularly bad results of plurality voting are: (1) It decisively limits the the number of candidates that can viably run, thus limiting political competition for populations to select the best leaders. (2) It tends to create two parties, who can then win elections by simply slinging mud to make the other party look worse rather than enacting constructive policy. See "further reading" for some of the game theory involved. 

Unfortunately, no voting method is "perfect." Every voting method has some drawbacks. But, research suggests that approval voting for single-winner elections (e.g. president) and proportional-representation for multi-winner elections (e.g. congress) would create the smallest gaps between what the population wants and what it gets. In approval voting elections, voters can select as many candidates as they approve and the candidate with the most votes wins. It is as simple-to-explain to the average voter as plurality voting, but allows for greater political competition and less difference between voters' preferences and results.

Voting method reform is likely less tractable and higher impact than public health causes, while it is likely more tractable and lower impact than existential risk causes. In the U.S., the state of Maine and several well-known cities (Minneapolis, Santa Fe) passed reform of voting methods in the last few years.
