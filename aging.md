<!-- TITLE: Anti-Aging -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Helping people live longer and healthier lives -->

* **Summary of the problem:** Aging is a major cause of disease and death.
* **Summary of solutions:** Research could reduce the amount of harm caused by aging.
* **General sense:** Anti-aging has already attracted billions of dollars in investment, but the allocation of this investment is largely not known. Anti-aging research seems tractable, but the cost-effectiveness is also unknown.
