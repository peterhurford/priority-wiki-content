<!-- SUBTITLE: Improving efficency of and access to energy -->

* **Summary of the problem:** Energy could be made to be less expensive, more clean, more safe, and more fairly distributed, thus alieviating a lot of conflict, harm to people, and harm to the environment.
* **Summary of solutions:** Discovering, improving, and advocating for alternative sources of power, such as atomic and solar energy.
* **General sense:** There is a very large amount of investment in energy, but not much is known about how to make this investment more effective or the cost-effectiveness of improvements in this space.
