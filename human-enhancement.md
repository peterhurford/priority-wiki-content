<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Human Enhancement -->

# Methods / Subtopics

### Requires significant research / non-actionable today
* Mental Prosthetics
	* Neural lace
* Genetic Engineering
* Systematic optimization of people's daily lives (Taking the 'very general' section and for every person, transform their habits and daily living into a more effective version systematically) 
	* Requires substantial hypothesizing, experimentation, and people willing to go along with it.


### Expensive 
* Nootropics
* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
	* [Video of it improving drawing abilities](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiP22kTxq_g)
* Medical interventions

### Very general / requires mostly behavioral change

Most gains to be had aren't upgrading your brain or body vis a vis extropianism. They are a thousand domain specific improvements to your daily life that add up.  

* Ergonomics
	* Computer posture (Many of us sit at them 10+ hours a day!)
	* Posture in general
* Lifestyle changes
	* Sleep 
		* [A Very Long List Of Sleep Matainance Suggestions](/https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9JFMhW9YHoTKbQEY2/a-very-long-list-of-sleep-maintenance-suggestions)
		* Polyphasic sleep? (Is this actually a thing that works? I swear I saw a video of scientists having tried it on an artist and the report was that it does - I remember it being very legit looking. And I've heard some ancedotes - at least one person who directly told me they had achieved it. But then there are things like 'supermemo' which say it is impossible.)
	* Diet (may require monetary gain in many cases?)
	* Exercise 
	* Other Habits
		* General computer usage 
			* (Switching to Linux helped me a lot.)
			* Two monitors			 
		* Video games 
			* (Became a lot more productive after I reduce game time after highschool. )
		* Smoking
* Mental Health
	* Depression
	* Daily environment / situation
		* Presence of harmful / toxic people in one's life
		* High stress from...
			* Finances
			* Work/School
		* Ineffective structure 
			* (example: you need schedules but parents are impulsive/don't plan)
			* Lack of support for goals
	* (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? I've heard it is useful but don't understand it)

	
### Skill based
* Learning Effectiveness
	* Study habits / techniques
	* Note taking techniques
* Work-based skill improvement
* Ability to set and reach goals or meet deadlines



### Common But Highly Specific Problems

(There are some things which happen regularly and generally enough that I think this section is warranted.)


Arguments over definitions
* Rationalist Taboo 
* [37 Ways That Suboptimal Use Of Categories Can Have Negative Side Effects On Your Cognition](/https://www.readthesequences.com/Thirty-Seven-Ways-That-Words-Can-Be-Wrong) (The Sequences had a huge impact for me in removing definitional arguments - This also belongs in mindsets / mental models, but unsure how to structure it.)


### mindsets / mental models 

(This section included because how we think about and engage with the world massively impacts our behavior) 
* [Mental models found repeatedly useful](/https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d)
* Regularly noticing and correcting problems
	* [Jordan Peterson's clean-your-room youtube video](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs) (There is probably a better way to get across this mentality, but I don't know it. Some people react negatively to Peterson so an edited/paraphrased transcript would be welcome.)
	* (Little things like regularly tripping over your bag. So you make a habit of putting your bag where it won't get tripped on.)
