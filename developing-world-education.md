<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Developing World Education -->

# Summary: 
Despite significant global attention and both governmental and philanthropic investment, student outcomes in the developing world remain very poor, leaving scope for interventions that will pay off long-term over the entire lifetimes of millions, if not billions. At present, UNESCO estimates that the number of children and adolescents failing to achieve minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics is 6 out of 10, or 617 million worldwide. 
The problem is not simple, and is complicated by intersecting disadvantages: factors such as poverty, poor health, poor nutrition, violence, early marriage, and lack of productive work opportunities all affect level of access to education and capacity to take advantage of opportunities. Even some recent successes (increased gender equality, stronger early childhood enrollment) bring unexpected flow-through issues, mostly related to quality of learning.
There is great scope for improvements across the board to improve the quality and the distribution of outcomes. Examples could include: enrollment; retention; quality of teaching and learning; teacher recruitment, development and management; national curriculums; use of technology in the classroom; and use of learning assessment and education data systems.
