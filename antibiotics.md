<!-- TITLE: Antibiotics -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Reducing risks from antibiotic resistence -->

**Summary of the problem:** Antibiotic resistence makes antibiotics less effective and creates a public health risk.
**Summary of solutions:** This risk could be reduced through education and advocacy around how antibiotics are overused or through research to create better antibiotics.
**General sense:** Federal governments already devote a lot of resources to this, but much about the scale and tractability is still unknown. Few major players outside of federal governments exist.
